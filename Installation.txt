PROSUM
PROATM ATM Adapters on FreeBSD


1. Introduction
===============

The PROATM adapters are based on the IDT77252 SAR and are not supported by the
idt driver Richard Hodges for IDT77211 SAR.

Prosum provides the proatm driver that is derived from the Richard Hodges driver
and the Prosum nicstar2 driver for the IDT77252 SAR. Proatm can be used with
kernel versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.1 and newer. It supports the ATM 25.6 Mbps and 155
Mbps Prosum card models and the UBR, CBR and VBR QoS. It is compatible with the
Host ATM Research Platform (HARP) software.

We recommend you to download the latest version of this driver from our web
site. You can contact us at the address indicated in section 5 regarding any
problem of for knowing the state of the pending version.


2. Installing proatm
====================

NOTE: If you are not familiar with building and installing a new kernel, please
refer to the FreeBSD Handbook.

Proatm is delivered in the form of a patch but you need not use the patch
utility to install it. Follow the procedure below.

* Copy proatm.c, proatm.h and proatm_rtbl.c into /usr/src/sys/pci.
* Copy atm_if.h into /usr/src/sys/netatm.

* in /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/YOUR_NAME add these entries:

        options     ATM_CORE	#core ATM protocol family
        options     ATM_IP      #IP over ATM support

* at least one (and usually one) of the following:

        options     ATM_SIGPVC  #SIGPVC signalling manager
        options     ATM_SPANS   #SPANS signalling manager
        options     ATM_UNI     #UNI signalling manager

* and the device driver:

        device      proatm0     #PROATM device driver (this file)

* on 3.5 and 3.51 kernel versions,add the following line to
/usr/src/sys/conf/files:

        pci/proatm.c    optional proatm device-driver

* on 4.1 and newer kernel versions,add the following line to
/usr/src/sys/conf/files:

        pci/proatm.c    optional proatm pci

* Then rebuild and install your kernel and reboot.

To rebuild and install your kernel, do the following in /usr/src/sys/i386/conf:

# config YOUR_NAME

# cd ../../compile/YOUR_NAME
# make depend
# make
# make install
# reboot
(old kernel is /kernel.old if you need it!)
